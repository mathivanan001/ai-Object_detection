# Real-Time Object Detection Project - README

## Project Overview
The Real-Time Object Detection project aims to identify and classify objects in live video feeds or static images with high accuracy and speed. This project leverages advanced machine learning models and computer vision libraries to provide seamless object detection capabilities for various use cases such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality applications.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes video streams in real time to detect objects with minimal latency.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), or Faster R-CNN for precise object detection.
- **Multiple Object Classes**: Detects and classifies multiple objects in a single frame.
- **Customizable Model**: Option to train and integrate custom object detection models.
- **User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for live video or image uploads.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the Real-Time Object Detection project:

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **CUDA Toolkit** (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathivanan001/ai-Object_detection.git
cd ai-Object_detection
```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Additional Setup
- **Download Pre-trained Weights**: If using pre-trained models like YOLO, download the weights and place them in the `weights/` directory.
- **Configure Model Settings**: Modify `config.py` to select the desired object detection model and parameters.

## Running the Object Detection
To start real-time object detection, run:
```bash
python detect.py
```

### Options
- **Image Detection**: To detect objects in a static image:
  ```bash
  python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
  ```
- **Webcam Detection**: For live video feed from the webcam:
  ```bash
  python detect.py --webcam
  ```

## Custom Model Training
To train a custom object detection model:
1. **Prepare Dataset**: Organize your dataset with labeled images.
2. **Configure Training Script**: Use `train.py` and set the necessary parameters in `config.py`.
3. **Run Training**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
